            <h1>Solidworks Views and Coordinate Systems</h1>
            <p>The intent is to better understand the coordinate system and view orientation as it affects library features and local coordinate systems in FEA.</p>
            <p>Solidworks uses a global coordinate system with the Y axis as the vertical by default. The 3 coordinate planes are labeled front, top, and right.</p>
            <p>The 3 standard orthoganal views are front, left, and top. The front view is a standard X-Y orientation. Left view is Z-Y, with Y being the vertical axis. The top view is Z-X. Using the right hand rule the perpendicular vector for each view is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Front: out of screen</li>
                <li>Left:  into screen</li>
                <li>Top:   out of screen</li>
            </ul>
